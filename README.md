I got tired of having no default app on my phone to draw on images. So I made a very, very simple one.

Feel free to do PRs to make it work better on your setup. It would be nice to have it work offline (i tried but just managed to prevent refreshes)

How to install

- git pull
- npm i

How to run locally (will transpile source to usable js and css)
- npm start

How to build
- npm run build
